		<h2>Impact On Young Girls</h2>
		<p> Wonder woman he was created to be a positive role-model and a strong female character for girls and boys, as she was one of the first female superheros to gain the love and popularity of thr crowd. She always emphasized qualities like power, sacrifice, and love of where you come from. Since her story started as a little girl doubting herself, many girls out there could appeal to such emotions and relate until we got to see her she slowly believe in herself by the support of her loving mother and the tough-love of her aunt who gifted Diana many of the skills she fosters. Later, the crowd of women heros rose and Wonder Woman got accompanied by her current super friends Batgirl and Supergirl all to claim the message of how strong girlpower can be.</p>

With her godlike abilities of incalculable superhuman strength, nigh-invulnerability, speed, flight, healing factor and semi-immortality, Diana’s fighting prowess is enhanced. In some versions, her mother trained her, as Wonder Girl, for a future career as Wonder Woman. From the beginning, she is portrayed as highly skilled in using her Amazon bracelets to stop bullets and in wielding her golden lasso. Batman once called her the "best melee fighter in the world". The modern version of the character is known to use lethal force when she deems it necessary.In the New 52 continuity, her superior combat skills are the result of her Amazon training, as well as receiving further training from Ares, the God of War, himself, since as early as her childhood.
